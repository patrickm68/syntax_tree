### Added

- The ability to "check" formatting by formatting the output of the first format.

### Changed

- Force a break if a block is attached to a `Command` or `CommandCall` node.
- Don't indent `CommandCall` arguments if they don't fit aligned.
- Force a break in `Call` nodes if there are comments on the receiver.
- Do not change block bounds if inside of a `Command` or `CommandCall` node.
- Handle empty parentheses inside method calls.
- Skip indentation for special array literals on assignment nodes.
- Ensure a final breakable is inserted when converting an `ArrayLiteral` to a `QSymbols`.
- Fix up the `doc_width` calculation for `CommandCall` nodes.
- Ensure parameters inside a lambda literal when there are no parentheses are grouped.
- Ensure when converting an `ArrayLiteral` to a `QWords` that the strings do not contain `[`.
