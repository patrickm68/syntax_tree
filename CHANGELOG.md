# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The ability to "check" formatting by formatting the output of the first format.
- Comments can now be attached to the `case` keyword.
- Remove escaped forward slashes from regular expression literals when converting to `%r`.
- Allow arrays of `CHAR` nodes to be converted to `QWords` under certain conditions.
- Allow `HashLiteral` opening braces to have trailing comments.
- Add parentheses if `Yield` breaks onto multiple lines.
- Ensure all nodes that could have heredocs nested know about their end lines.
- Ensure comments on assignment after the `=` before the value keep their place.
- Trailing comments on parameters with no parentheses now do not force a break.
- Allow `ArrayLiteral` opening brackets to have trailing comments.

### Changed

- Force a break if a block is attached to a `Command` or `CommandCall` node.
- Don't indent `CommandCall` arguments if they don't fit aligned.
- Force a break in `Call` nodes if there are comments on the receiver.
- Do not change block bounds if inside of a `Command` or `CommandCall` node.
- Handle empty parentheses inside method calls.
- Skip indentation for special array literals on assignment nodes.
- Ensure a final breakable is inserted when converting an `ArrayLiteral` to a `QSymbols`.
- Fix up the `doc_width` calculation for `CommandCall` nodes.
- Ensure parameters inside a lambda literal when there are no parentheses are grouped.
- Ensure when converting an `ArrayLiteral` to a `QWords` that the strings do not contain `[`.
- Stop looking for parent `Command` or `CommandCall` nodes in blocks once you hit `Statements`.
- Ensure nested `Lambda` nodes get their correct bounds.
- Ensure we do not change block bounds within control flow constructs.
- Ensure parentheses are added around keywords changing to their modifier forms.
- Allow conditionals to take modifier form if they are using the `then` keyword with a `VoidStmt`.
- `UntilMod` and `WhileMod` nodes that wrap a `Begin` should be forced into their modifier forms.
- Ensure `For` loops keep their trailing commas.
- Replicate content for `__END__` keyword exactly.
- Keep block `If`, `Unless`, `While`, and `Until` forms if there is an assignment in the predicate.
- Force using braces if the block is within the predicate of a conditional or loop.
- Allow for the possibility that `CommandCall` nodes might not have arguments.
- Explicitly handle `?"` so that it formats properly.
- Check that a block is within the predicate in a more relaxed way.
- Ensure the `Return` breaks with brackets and not parentheses.
- Ensure trailing comments on parameter declarations are consistent.
- Make `Command` and `CommandCall` aware that their arguments could exceed their normal expected bounds because of heredocs.
- Only unescape forward slashes in regular expressions if converting from slash bounds to `%r` bounds.
- Allow `When` nodes to grab trailing comments away from their statements lists.
- Allow flip-flop operators to be formatted correctly within `IfMod` and `UnlessMod` nodes.
- Allow `IfMod` and `UnlessMod` to know about heredocs moving their bounds.
- Properly handle breaking parameters when there are no parentheses.
- Properly handle trailing operators in call chains with attached comments.
- Force using braces if the block is within the predicate of a ternary.
- Properly handle trailing comments after a `then` operator on a `When` or `In` clause.
- Ensure nested `HshPtn` nodes use braces.
- Force using braces if the block is within a `Binary` within the predicate of a loop or conditional.

### Removed

- The `AccessCtrl` node in favor of just formatting correctly when you hit a `Statements` node.
- The `MethodAddArg` node is removed in favor of an optional `arguments` field on `Call` and `FCall`.
